# BingoSync Tracker

A tracker for bingosync scores, that outputs them to txt files.

It also includes capabilities to automate the OBS layout creation via symlinks.

Neither capability is deeemed essential, however, and they're allowed to be ran without the other.


Credits to Tim (formerly known as Oddbod) for the original bingosync listener code and idea, and to KatieQT for the GUI code and idea

Releases are configured around the Hollow Knight Speedruns Twitch Channel's standard filepath
