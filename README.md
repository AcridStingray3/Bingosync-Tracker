# BingoSync Tracker

A simple tracker for bingosync scores, that outputs them to txt files.

Configured around the Hollow Knight Speedruns Twitch Channel's standard filepath

It also includes capabilities to automate the OBS layout creation.

Neither capability is deeemed essential, however, and they're allowed to be ran without the other.


Credits to Tim (formerly known as Oddbod) for the original bingosync listener code.
